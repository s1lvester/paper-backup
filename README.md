# paper-backup

@splitbrain wrote a [blog-post](https://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2014-08/24-paper_backup_2_automation_scripts) in 2014 which featured his version of a backup-solution using a rpi and some scanner. All of the credit belongs to him.

Meanwhile, flash-forward 2017 some of the software has progressed significantly, so when I took up this adventure I used his codebase to implement my solution. So feel free to have a look around. I wrote some additional notes in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/0fb021dbe07a9b6d9e8e4078c8449fb9) on how to set it all up.

@slpitbrain didn't include a licence so I won't either.
